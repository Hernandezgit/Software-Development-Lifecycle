# 8-2 Journal
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is an essential part of creating programs that will best meet users’ needs and expectations. One way of going about this is by creating “user stories”. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. This helps to ensure that all user needs are taken into consideration and that the user’s perspectives are accounted for in the development process.

Approaching development processes requires an understanding of the software development process and an ability to work within that process. I hope to incorporate an agile process such as Scrum into my software development, as it allows for rapid iteration and frequent feedback which is essential to building successful software. This approach requires solid communication and continued collaboration with all involved parties, as well as an understanding of the scope and goals of the project.

Being a good team member in software development means learning to work collaboratively and take on different roles in order to meet the goals of the project in an efficient and timely manner. Good team members are able to listen to others’ input and feedback, communicate well, and take on tasks with initiative. Additionally, they must be willing to learn new ways of doing things and be open to different perspectives. Working as part of a team also requires patience and respect for all members.
